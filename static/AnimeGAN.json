        "description": "## Code Analysis\n\n**Quick Summary:**\n\nThis function applies a 2x2 max pooling operation to a tensor (referred to as 'bottom') with a stride of 2. This operation downsamples the data by taking the maximum value within each 2x2 window, effectively reducing its spatial dimensions. This type of operation is commonly used in convolutional neural networks for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction.\n\n**Inputs:**\n\n* `bottom`:  A 4-dimensional tensor representing the input data.  \n* `ksize=[1, 2, 2, 1]`: Defines the size of the pooling window (height, width, in_channels, out_channels).  \n* `strides=[1, 2, 2, 1]`:  Specifies the step size of the pooling operation (height, width, in_channels, out_channels).\n* `padding='SAME'`: Ensures output has the same spatial dimensions as the input after pooling.\n* `name`: An optional string name for the operation.\n\n**Output:**\n\n* A 4-dimensional tensor, downsampled version of the input data.\n\n\n"
